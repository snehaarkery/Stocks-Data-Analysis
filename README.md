# Stock-Analysis-and-Prediction

This Project aims to understand the factors influencing the stock prices. I have considered the Yahoo finance data for a set of companies and plotted it's correlation with company's performance
and human sentiments for that company. Also built a simple machine learning model using linear regression to predict the stock price variations in the future.
